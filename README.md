# Project-2
UMBC CMSC 331 Project 2: This Project builds on [Project 1] (http://userpages.umbc.edu/~rommel1/CMSC331/Project1/) and adds the following:

  * two more data points were added to the DB, where the advisors' offices are located, and where they will meet with their student. When a student signs up for an appointment, this is also shown.



* The “work screen” (or where work shows up) was enhanced to ensure a pleasurable experience for all users. This includes resizing of items and a more aesthetic user experience.



* Code reusablity was improved by the extraction and encapsulation of server requests and commonly used parts such as a page's footer and CSS.
